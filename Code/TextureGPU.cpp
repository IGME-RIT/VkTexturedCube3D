// Texture buffers are a little different from other GPU buffers. They require
// extra information to let our GPU know what type of texture we are dealing with,
// what format the texture is in, as well as extra information for mipmap textures.

// pixel data that was in the texture file, but the GPU won't know what to do with it.
